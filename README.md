# NYC-Tree-Census-Data-Visualization

## Background

This project will be focusing on the 2015 NYC Tree Census data that was made available by NYC Open Data. The whole purpose of the project is to allow a user to be able to research trees in their area. For instance, they would be able to find where any living American Beech tree would be in their area.

As said, this data will be coming from NYC Open Data, which is free data that is available to the general public on city information. This will be the only data source that I will be using, as it will have all the information I will need. In order to represent the data, I will be using D3 to assist in creating tables and charts for the user to see. 

## Functionality and MVPs

With the NYC Tree Census Data Visualization, users will be able to:

- Look up different tree species
- Add filters to their search
- Choose a variety of ways to display their data (bar, pie, etc.)
- Have the ability to update filters and search again in real time.

In addition, this project will include:

- The ability to switch between different visualizations of the data
- The functionality to add another selector to the filter

## Technologies, Libraries, APIs

- [NYC Open Data 2015 Tree Census Dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2015-Street-Tree-Census-Tree-Data/uvpi-gqnh)
- Chart.js

## Implementation Timeline

- Friday afternoon & weekend: Establish connection with database and ensure that all necessary requests are able to come through. During this time I would also like to figure out how to properly filter information when making reuests so the user can have multiple filters at one time. 
- Monday: Focus on how to implement Chart.js in order to visualize the data appropriately. If there is time I would also like to figure out the ability to represent data in different ways. 
- Tuesday: Render to page. At this point I want to get something functioning on the page. Styling at this point is not necessary.
- Wednesday: Style the project up to it's current status. Features can be added, but I want base styling to be added today. At this point I would also like to add it to Github pages. 
- Thursday morning: Testing site wide and fixing any bugs that are still present or have yet to be found. The goal is to limit my work to making sure the site is working.
